DESCRIPTION

Hotline::Client is a class implementing a limited Hotline internet client
in Perl.  It was specifically developed to aid in the creation of Hotline
"bots."  Hotline is an internet client/server system that's a sort of cross
between IRC and a BBS.  See http://www.hotlinesw.com/ for more information.

INSTALLATION

The standard incantations should work:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

Here are a few common variations on that theme:

* If you don't want to or can't install in the system-wide directories,
  you can use PREFIX to install elsewhere.  Example:

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~
	make
	make install

  You'll probably have to create some dummy directories before this works.
  Just look at the error messages and create the directories it says it
  can't find.

* If you're installing on a Mac OS system, the simplest way to get going
  is to drag the entire contents of the "lib" folder into the "lib" folder
  in your MacPerl folder.
