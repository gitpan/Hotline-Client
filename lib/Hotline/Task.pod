=head1 DESCRIPTION

Hotline::Task is a simple class for storing and retrieving task
information,  You should never have to create your own Hotline::Task
objects when using Hotline::Client.  Getting and (to a lesser extent)
setting attributes is all that should be necessary.

If given an argument, they set an attribute.  In all cases, they
return the current value of the attribute.
